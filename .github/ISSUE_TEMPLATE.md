Please make sure that you understand and can know the following before you submit your issue! This will help us get back to you as soon as possible.

- [ ] Specify what specifications you have (particularly: Compiler/IDE wtih Version, Build System, and any other relevant information (Objective-C++, etc...))
- [ ] You have the compiler error / compiler output available, in the case of a compiler error. OR. You have the runtime error that occurs, in the case of a failed script (use `safe_script`/`safe_script_file` to have sol2 attempt to generate a backtrace for you).
- [ ] You have the example code that generates the problem. If it's deeply embroiled in your library / framework / application and it is not reproducible, the best we can do for you is guess at solutions.
