Okay, so the features don't convince you, the documentation doesn't convince you, you want to see what *other* people think about Sol? Well, aside from the well-wishes that come through in the issue tracker, here's a few things floating around about sol2 that I occasionally get pinged about:


* (Reddit) Posts on reddit about it
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/4a8gy7/sol2_lua_c_binding_framework/
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/4x82hd/plain_c_versus_lua_libraries_benchmarking_speed/
* (CppNow) sol2 was mentioned in a comparison to other scripting languages by ChaiScript developer, Jason Turner (@lefticus), at a conference!
	- https://github.com/lefticus/presentations/blob/master/HowAndWhyToAddScripting.md
* (CppCast) Showed up in CppCast with Elias Daler

And, of course, I use it. Isn't that enough?
